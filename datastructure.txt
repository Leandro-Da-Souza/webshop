Data Flow
 
App.vue -> sends prop data to:
    Products.vue / consists of many Items.vue where we loop through prop data where we can send the     single item to: ->
                SingleProductView.vue

         <- SingleProductView.vue / where we pass the data up to 
    <- Products.vue
App.vue ->

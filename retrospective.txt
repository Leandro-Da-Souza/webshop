arbVad har ni lärt er av projektet?
We learnt to develop using TDD principles as our guiding light. 
We sharpened our knowledge of Agile through this process. 
Patience with the process allowed us to see the bigger picture. 


Hur fördelade ni arbetet? (vem gjorde vad)
Before delving into the project, we took the time to lay the ground work. 
As a group we discussed and made a wireframe, the prototype and the data structure.
This informed how we allocated tasks through out the project.

Fundera över vilka ändringar ni skulle göra om ni skulle fortsätta med projektet i samma grupp:
Although we stuck to the principles of Agile and TDD at the beginning, we realised that we regressed into old habits as the deadline for the project drew nearer. 
This, by far, is the point we would as a collective, would like to improve upon.

Vad skulle vi börja göra?
We should start working on adding increment and decrement functionality to our sight. 
Refactoring the project to run in vuex, a database running in the backend etc.  

Vad skulle vi sluta göra?
Stop rushing the process so we can reap the full benefits of TDD. 

Vad skulle vi fortsätta göra?
Continue adhering and learning about the Agile process, as it leads to better and more stable results in the long run.

Vilka krav var svårast respektive lättast att skriva test för?
The test for general access to the data in the template was easier than testing for the dynamic properties in the project.

Fanns det något ni hade tänkt göra, som ni inte hann med? Vad berodde det på?
increase/decrement functionality, ran out of time.
